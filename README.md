Description: Comparison of global tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (data supplement to _"Pandemic spotlight on urban water quality"_). NO<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen dioxide) in the tropospheric column (mol.cm<sup>-2</sup>) were averaged over the first 14 days following the Vernal equinox in 2019, and likewise in 2020, several weeks after many countries worldwide initiated lockdowns. Data were aggregated using the [NASA Earthdata Giovanni web interface](https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/) using data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument aboard NASA's Aura satellite, 30% cloud screened, daily 0.25Â° resolution.
